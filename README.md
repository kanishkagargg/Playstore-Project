# Playstore-Project

Leveraging Python for exploratory data analysis (EDA) on Play Store data reveals valuable insights. This EDA process involves examining the dataset's structure, identifying patterns, and extracting meaningful information, enabling informed decisions for optimizing app performance, refining monetization strategies, and enhancing overall user satisfaction in the competitive app market.

This project is divided into  parts:
1) Know your data: Imported libraries, dataset loading, and first view, info, knowing duplicates and missing values.
2) Understanding Your Variables: Column names, describe, unique values.
3) Data Wrangling: Removal of duplicates, handling null values, changing data types, handling inconsistant values.
4) Data Vizualization, Storytelling & Experimenting with charts
